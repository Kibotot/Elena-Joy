# Elena-Joy

# Elena Joy is a photographer who likes flowers and people to take photos of.
# She said she want's a simple site that represents her work. So I made one.
# It has bit flexbox, a bit of grid, a just a tiny bit of JS to make burger menu work on mobile phones.
# Animations are part of this design, not transitions but only simple animations in the background
# so her flowers feel alive once again.

# This website is made for personal use only.
